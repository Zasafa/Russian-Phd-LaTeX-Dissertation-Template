abstract  ="Nanoparticles have a fundamental limit as to how much light they can absorb. This limit is based on the finite number of modes excited in the nanoparticle at a given wavelength and maximum absorption capacity per mode. The enhanced absorption can be achieved when each mode supported by the nanoparticle absorbs light up to the maximum capacity. Using a stochastic optimization algorithm{,} we design multilayer nanoparticles{,} in which we can make several resonant modes overlap at the same frequency resulting in superabsorption. We further introduce the efficiency of the absorption for a nanoparticle{,} which is the absorption normalized by the physical size of the particle{,} and show that efficient absorbers do not always operate in the superabsorption regime."
